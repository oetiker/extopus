Simple Dependency Build Scripts
-------------------------------

You want to install tool X and find that it needs library Y and perl
module Z. If you are lucky, Y and Z are available as packages for your
OS and you can install them. But often, X requires the latest version of Y
and Z is so obscure it only exists on CPAN. Enters sdbs:

 build_x_deps.sh:

 #!/bin/bash
 . `dirname $0`/sdbs.inc
 simplebuild http://www.X.com/downloads/ Y-23.tar.gz
 perlmodule Y

By default the script will build and install everything in ../thirdparty
relative to its own location. You can call the script with an argument
if you want the installation to go somewhere else.

Enjoy!
