=head1 NAME

EP::Index - Extopus Documentation Index

=head1 ADMIN DOCUMENTAION

Extopus consists of two main components. A backend written in perl and a
frontend written in javascript. The frontend talks to the backend via web
requests. Mostly JSON-RPC but also some normal GET requests for graphcs and
other downloads.

All frontend configuration comes from the backend, so unless you are
about to add additional visualization modules to the frontend, all you need to
handle as an extopus admin is the backend configuration.

There may be some additional information on your local setup in your L<Local Guide|EP::LocalGuide>.
